# Data-jobs-dashboards-PowerBI

Power BI dashboards analyzing the data job market: salaries, top skills, and job trends (multi-page + executive summary).

---

## Introduction
This repository contains two Power BI dashboards created to analyze the **data job market**.
The objective of these dashboards is to provide insight into job demand, required skills, and salary trends across different data roles.

Many job seekers struggle to understand:
- Which data roles are most in demand
- Which skills are most required across job postings
- Which job titles offer the highest pay
- How salaries vary across job titles and countries

To address this, I built two dashboards:
1. **Data Jobs Dashboard (Multi-Page Report)**  
2. **Data Jobs Dashboard 2.0 (Executive Summary Dashboard)**
